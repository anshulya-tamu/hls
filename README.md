# **SARAH-CONUS: Sub-weekly Area of Reservoirs from Analysis of Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data for Continental US** 

<p align="justify">
Welcome to the official repository for our sub-weekly reservoir surface area mapping algorithm. This project focuses on applying a <strong>Random Forest (RF) classification model</strong> and a <strong>refined image enhancement algorithm</strong> to <strong>Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel (HLS)</strong> imagery, producing <strong>sub-weekly</strong> surface area time series for thousands of reservoirs in the <strong>Continental United States (CONUS)</strong>.

## **Project Description**

This project aims to generate **sub-weekly reservoir surface area time series** for reservoirs across the Continental United States. By using **Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS)** datasets, we can overcome the trade-off between **spatial resolution (30 m)** and **temporal frequency (~2–6 days)**. Our approach includes:

- **Random Forest Classification**: Classify each pixel in HLS data into *Water, Land, Cloud,* or *Ice*.  
- **Enhanced Image Correction**: Address cloud contamination and mixed-pixel misclassifications using a physics-based enhancement algorithm.  
- **Sub-Weekly Time Series**: Merge classification outputs over time to form near-real-time reservoir surface area time series.  
- **LOWESS Gap-Filling**: Interpolate or smooth out missing or outlier data points where reservoir imagery is unusable (>95% cloud cover).

**Key Findings**  
- Achieves R² = 0.98 and bias < 10% when compared to in-situ data from 240 reservoirs.  
- Offers **sub-weekly** temporal resolution, providing richer intra-monthly dynamics than typical monthly products.  
- Demonstrates utility for water resource management, hydropower, flood risk analysis, and broader hydrological studies.

## **Features / Pipeline Overview**

1. **Reservoir Identification**  
   - Leverages the [Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) v1.3](https://globaldamwatch.org/grand/) dataset to locate ~1,900 CONUS reservoirs of various sizes, shapes, and climatic zones.

2. **HLS Data Acquisition**  
   - Downloads the **HLS (v1.4) surface reflectance** product from NASA’s LP-DAAC for 2016–2023.  
   - Tiles are automatically merged if a reservoir crosses multiple HLS tiles.

3. **Random Forest Classification**  
   - Trained on a labeled set of ~3.48 million pixels spanning *water, land, cloud,* and *ice* classes.  
   - Incorporates spectral bands (e.g., NIR, SWIR), water indices (NDWI, NDMI, etc.), and 3×3 spatial averages.

4. **Refined Image Enhancement**  
   - Cloud/mixed-pixel correction using a dynamic threshold approach based on **water occurrence data** (Pekel et al., 2016).  
   - Identifies edge pixels in the reservoir to extrapolate the *true* water boundary more accurately.

5. **Time Series Extraction**  
   - Computes surface area by counting classified “water” pixels and converting to km².  
   - Excludes days when >95% of the reservoir area is cloud-covered.

6. **LOWESS Smoothing and Outlier Removal**  
   - Fills gaps on cloudy days and filters spurious outliers.  
   - Ensures a continuous sub-weekly surface area record.

7. **Validation**  
   - Compared against daily in-situ reservoir areas at 240 sites.  
   - Demonstrates robust performance across reservoir size classes and climatic regimes.

## **Example**

A more detailed demonstration is provided in the examples/ folder:
1. `examples/multi-tile.ipynb`  
    - Walks through data download, classification, enhancement, and final time series plotting for a single small reservoir.  
    - Illustrates how to handle special cases (e.g., ice coverage, ephemeral water bodies).
